Tested in: 3.4.2

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to display the latest posts of all blogs on your main wpmu site.

=== Normal Usage ===

Insert "[recent_mu_posts howmany=10]" into the content of a page, where "howmany=10" is how many posts you would like to display.

=== Optional usage ===

You can optionally use this in your theme by adding the code below into your theme file, this is not recomended due to the fact that if you change your theme it will not work in your new theme.

`<?php do_shortcode('[recent_mu_posts howmany=10]'); ?>`
